            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The human immune system naturally surveils and attempts to eliminate cancer cells, but tumors employ sophisticated evasion strategies, such as downregulating antigens, expressing immune checkpoints, and creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Immunotherapy revolutionizes cancer treatment by harnessing and enhancing the body's own immune defenses to overcome these evasive tactics. Key approaches include immune checkpoint inhibitors that "release the brakes" on T cells, adoptive cell therapies like CAR T-cell therapy that genetically engineer immune cells, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, cancer treatment vaccines, oncolytic viruses that selectively destroy cancer cells, and cytokine therapies that modulate immune responses. While these therapies have achieved remarkable successes, leading to durable remissions, challenges remain in predicting patient response, managing immune-related adverse events, and overcoming the complex immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment, driving ongoing research into personalized and combination treatment strategies.</p>

            <h2>Section 1: Foundational Principles of Liquid Biopsy and Molecular Residual Disease</h2>
            <p>The management of cancer is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by technologies that allow for the detection and characterization of tumors with unprecedented sensitivity. Central to this evolution are the concepts of liquid biopsy and molecular residual disease (MRD). Together, they represent a paradigm shift away from anatomical assessment toward a more dynamic, molecular understanding of cancer. This section establishes the fundamental scientific and clinical principles that underpin this approach, defining the core concepts, describing the key biological analytes shed by tumors, and explaining why the detection of subclinical disease is a critical objective in modern oncology.</p>

            <h3>1.1 The Paradigm of Liquid Biopsy: Moving Beyond the Tissue Standard</h3>
            <p>A liquid biopsy is a laboratory test performed on a sample of bodily fluid—most commonly blood, but also potentially urine, saliva, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)—to detect and analyze cancer-derived biomarkers. This technique offers a minimally invasive or entirely non-invasive alternative to the traditional "gold standard" of cancer diagnosis: the surgical tissue biopsy. While tissue biopsy remains indispensable for the initial diagnosis and histological classification of a tumor, its limitations are significant and well-documented. The procedure is invasive, carrying inherent risks of pain, infection, and bleeding, and can involve substantial cost and recovery time.</p>

            <p>Perhaps more critically from a biological standpoint, a tissue biopsy provides only a single, localized snapshot of a tumor at one specific moment. This is often insufficient to capture the full spectrum of intratumoral heterogeneity—the complex genetic and molecular diversity that exists within a single tumor and between different metastatic sites. A tumor is not a monolithic entity; it is an evolving ecosystem of distinct subclones. A biopsy needle may sample one region while missing another that harbors key resistance mutations. This sampling bias can lead to an incomplete and potentially misleading molecular profile, impacting treatment decisions.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Liquid biopsy for MRD detection is no longer a distant promise but a clinical reality that is actively reshaping patient management in oncology. While formidable challenges in standardization, validation, and implementation persist, the powerful convergence of ultra-sensitive molecular technologies and advanced computational analysis is clearing the path for a new era of precision medicine. This future is one where cancer treatment is not a static prescription but a dynamic, adaptive process, tailored in real time to the molecular state of a patient's disease. The ultimate goal is to intercept relapse at its earliest and most vulnerable stage, thereby personalizing the very definition of a cure.</p>
